 *
 * =========================
 * DESCRIPTION
 * =========================
 * Implements various enhancements to Something Awful forums browsing. Enhancements include:
 *
 * User Control Panel:
 * - Button that will open all unread threads in new tabs.
 *
 * Thread List:
 * - Move ratings next to thread title, to more easily scan for gold threads.
 * - Hide threads by hellbanned users
 * - Only show ratings for threads if a minimum number of people have voted (useful for FYAD where the threshold is very low)
 *
 * Thread View:
 * - Hellban users. A hellbanned user is effectively erased from your browsing experience. Their posts will be removed,
 *   including responses to their posts by non-hellbanned users.
 * - Hide posts that don't contain images. Useful for image threads where too many people just comment without posting content.
 * - Prevent image spamming. Any more than 3 images in a quote are removed, to prevent the case where people quote a large
 *   post full of images and just add a one line comment.
 * - Filter low content posts. Hides post that are just empty quotes or single-emoticon posts.
 * - Streamline view. For quickly skimming a long thread. Strips the page of any extraneous content, showing more posts per-page.
 * - Hide avatars. Client-side preference for scrubbing avatars/custom-titles, so you can (for example) show avatars at home but not at work.
 *
 * =========================
 * USING THIS SCRIPT
 * =========================
 * After installation, each page will have a small bar near the bottom "SA++ preferences". Click the "Edit" button to alter
 * preferences. Some preferences are site-wide (e.g. "Hide Avatars"), some are thread-specific (e.g. "Hide posts with no text or images").
 *
 * -------------------------
 * Hellbanning
 * -------------------------
 * Hellbanning a user will erase them from your browsing experience. All their posts, threads, and even their quotes in other posts, will
 * be removed.
 * - To hellban a user, click "Hellban" under one of their posts.
 * - To unhellban a user, click "Edit" in the preferences bar at the bottom of the page, click "View Hellbanned users"
 *		and then click "Unhellban" next to the name of the user.
 *
 * =========================
 * USAGE NOTES
 * =========================
 * Known issues:
 * - The preference state is stored in RAM on each page, so if you (say) hellban a user in one tab, then
 *   move to another tab and hellban another, the prefs will be completely overwritten and you'll lose the first pref.
 *   This can be fixed by reloading the prefs before tweaking and saving them but I haven't gotten around to it.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This code depends on the following environment:
 * - SA Last Read FF extension (SALR) is installed. 
 * - Adblock is installed
 * - SA user configuration is set up in a particular way.
 *
 * For me, this script works when each of the above has the following settings. Failure to follow this configuration MAY
 * mean that the script doesn't work at all, but as far as I know there isn't any conflict with ANY settings. I
 * haven't tested user sigs though.
 * 
 * SALR config:
 * - General options:
 *   Hide forum header/footer [UNCHECKED]
 * - Forums:
 *   All features [UNCHECKED]
 * 
 * Adblock config:
 *  |http://forums.somethingawful.com/css/rfa.css
 *  |http://forums.somethingawful.com/css/fyad.css
 * These shouldn't affect the script, but failing to block these may have unexpected results when streamlining.
 *
 * SA user options: http://forums.somethingawful.com/member.php?action=editoptions
 * - Mark posts on pages I've already seen in a different color: YES
 * - Show user's signatures in their posts? : NO
 * - Show member ad banners? : NO - I have "No Ads", so I don't know if this script works when Ads are enabled.
 *
 * =========================
 * DEVELOPMENT NOTES
 * =========================
 * Class overview:
 * - Page: The page controller. This determines the page type from the URL, bootstraps each page type's
 *   handler and passes control over to it in the handle() method. It also contains some page-related utility functions.
 *
 * Page handlers:
 * - ThreadList:			The page that displays a list of threads to view
 * - ThreadView				A page of posts
 * - UserControlPanel		The User Control Panel or Bookmarked Threads page
 * - NewThread				Form for posting a new thread
 * - ThreadReply			Form for replying to an existing thread
 * - PrivateMessageEntry	Form for posting a new private message, or replying to one
 *
 * Each handler has a method "handle()" which is run once when the page loads. This is where it will do its per-page
 * manipulations.
 *
 * Other classes:
 * - User:					A SA User
 * - Users:					The list of Users from the preferences
 * - Thread:				A single Thread in the ThreadList
 * - Post:					A single Post in the ThreadView
 * - Smilies:				Emoticon search functionality
 * - LocalStorage:			Utility class that encapsulates persisting data to Firefox's local store
 * - Util:					Utility class, mostly DOM manipulation.
 * - Prefs:					Utility class for persisting user preferences.
